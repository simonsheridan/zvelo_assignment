## Simple React / Redux App to Report Malicious Sites

The goal of this web app is to demonstrate a knowledge of react / redux.

To run the web app, simply git clone this repo and double-click the index.html file to open it in your browser.

[This project](https://github.com/jackielii/simplest-redux-example) was used to generate something that would run in the browser standalone (much harder to accomplish than I would have thought!) and provided some structure for writing very simple react / redux apps in es2015.

The bundle.js file contains everything, including the source, rolled together and transpiled to es5 (except for the extra credit data file).  The index.source.js file is there to see the source.

There are no styles at all (no time), only pure, semantic, html!

###I Would Improve:
  - React warnings appear in the browser console(they want me to generate an ID for each iterated element)
  - All user interactions are very basic!  No validation, it's very difficult to enter a custom time (everything is using a timestamp), etc
